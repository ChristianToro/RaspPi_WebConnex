HOW TO CREATE credentials.json FOR GOOGLE SHEETS API
====================================================

STEP 1: Enable Google Sheets API
--------------------------------
1. Go to the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. In the navigation menu:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Sheets API"
   - Click "Enable"
4. Also enable the "Google Drive API" by searching and enabling it similarly.

STEP 2: Create Service Account Credentials
------------------------------------------
1. In the navigation menu:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "Service Account"
2. Name the service account (e.g., InternetMonitorService) and click "Create and Continue" until done.

STEP 3: Generate credentials.json
---------------------------------
1. In the "Service Accounts" section, click the newly created account.
2. Go to the "Keys" tab.
3. Click "Add Key" > "Create new key"
4. Choose "JSON" and click "Create"
5. A file named `credentials.json` will download to your computer.
6. Move this file to your Raspberry Pi in: /home/pi/internet_monitor/credentials.json

STEP 4: Share the Google Sheet with the Service Account
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Open the Google Sheet you want to sync with (or create one named "Internet Stats").
2. Open the credentials.json file and copy the "client_email" field.
3. Share the Google Sheet with that email address, giving it Editor access.

NOTE:
-----
Your Raspberry Pi script can now authenticate and update the sheet programmatically using this credentials.json.
